# Code_Editor

Code Pen  is a live code editing application built with React. It features three distinct editors for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to write and preview their code in real-time. The editors are enhanced with CodeMirror, providing a rich and interactive coding environment.

The application uses React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage code state and dynamically update the rendered output. Changes made in the editors are immediately reflected in the `iframe` below, which combines the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a live preview. The `iframe` is sandboxed to ensure secure code execution, keeping the environment safe from accessing sensitive information.
